# Prediction-based-on-training-data
In this repository I will upload python code for predicting output based on training data and output will be based on test data set.  
**1st Sub Project:**  house price predicting model
So, in this code I have taken the data of house features for **house price predicting model**.
By uploading training data set and testing data set, you can fetch a csv file of output based on your data.
I have used the model "Random Forest regressor" for this.
I have attached the out file also.  
**2nd Sub Project :**  Prediction of Listening Time of Song
With the help of this code you can predict the listening time of song. You just have to add the test data and train data which includes your data of listening  which song and stiming and all of some days.
When you execute this python code then the answer will be like this,

And you will get an excel sheet also of prediction.

**#rd Sub Project:** Prediction-of-rainfall-model
In this model we will predict the rainfall  based on the data given in training data.
By using train and test data, we will will run our code and the output will be like something given below:

So, here is output. You can do modification in the code according to your data.
