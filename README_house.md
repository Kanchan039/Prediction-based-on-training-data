# Prediction-based-on-training-data
In this repository I will upload python code for predicting output based on training data and output will be based on test data set. 

So, in this code I have taken the data of house features for **house price predicting model**.
By uploading training data set and testing data set, you can fetch a csv file of output based on your data.
I have used the model "Random Forest regressor" for this.
I have attached the out file also.
please have a look. In case of any querry or suggestion, you can contact me.
